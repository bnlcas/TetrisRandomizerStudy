Random Tetris Study
=================

A quick study on how different types of random sequences of tetraminoes affects the gameplay of Tetris.
Code forked from ([here](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris)).
 
A few simple variations:
* True Random - tiles are selected at random.
* Non Sequential Random - tiles are selected at random with no repeats.
* Doom: all bad options (this will happen in true random).
* Bliss: Only the good tiles.
* Reprieve: Tiles are better as the stack gets higher.
* Collapse: Tiles get worse as the stack gets higher.
